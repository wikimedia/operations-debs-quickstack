Description: Tool to take call stack traces with minimal overheads.
 There are a couple of tools to take stack traces such as gdb, pstack,
 but these tools have serious overheads. In many cases, target process
 stops for 0.2-N seconds. So it is dangerous to use such tools in
 production environment. quickstack makes it possible to take stack
 traces in less than 1 milliseconds. This is much smaller overhead so
 you can frequently take stack traces in production environment. 
 .
 quickstack internally scans stack frames and guesses caller
 functions. For 64bit applications, it is highly recommended to build
 with -fno-omit-frame-pointer.
